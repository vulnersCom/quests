# Vulners Hack Quests
Some easy / and not hack quests.
Take a try!

## ZIP brute challenge

Password protected archives are common cases. But can you brute them effectively?
Take a look at the files:
* isox_zipquest_1.zip
* isox_zipquest_hint.zip

Can you decrypt and open them?
Both are protected by the short passwords and it's not a task about making GPU farm for the bruteforce.
